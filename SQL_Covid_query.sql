
--Title : Exploratory Data Analysis - COVID Deaths and Vaccinations

--Objective: The objective is to give insights of COVID-19. For that, It will be shown how is the number of deaths and vaccinations for each continent and country. 
			--This analysis is based on real data about covid 19 from January 2020 to July 2021 using MS Server.

--The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 situation globally, highlighting variations in the number of deaths and vaccinations 
-- across different regions and identifying What are the most important factors that have contributed to the spread of the pandemic.

--1) Checking for null values, duplicate values, change data types and total rows in both tables
--2) Top 10 country which have highest no. of avg death by day and highest death_percentage by population.
--3) which countries have the highest rate of infection in relation to population ?
--4) Which continents and locations have the highest average percentage of COVID-19 cases relative to their population?
--5) what percentage of the population vaccinated for each country?
--6) What is the rolling average of new COVID-19 cases over a 7-day period for each location in Europe?
